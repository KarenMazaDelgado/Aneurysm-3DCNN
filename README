# Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Overview

A web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game comparing Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms.

## Features

- Three game modes: Human vs Human, Human vs AI, AI vs AI
- Algorithm selection (Minimax or Alpha-Beta)
- Real-time performance metrics
- Algorithm comparison tool
- Modern, intuitive UI

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:

```bash
python server.py
```

2. Open browser to: `http://localhost:5000`

## How to Use

### Human vs AI Mode

1. Select "Player vs AI" from Game Mode dropdown
2. Choose your algorithm (Minimax or Alpha-Beta)
3. Select whether to play as X (first) or O (second)
4. Click "New Game"
5. Click cells to make your move

### AI vs AI Mode

1. Select "AI vs AI" from Game Mode dropdown
2. Choose algorithms for both AIs
3. Click "New Game"
4. Watch the AIs battle automatically
5. Use "Pause" button to control playback

### Algorithm Comparison

1. Play at least one move
2. Click "Compare Algorithms"
3. View side-by-side performance metrics

## Algorithms

### Minimax

- Explores all possible game states
- Guarantees optimal play
- Higher node count

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

- Optimized version of Minimax
- Prunes unnecessary branches
- Same optimal result, fewer nodes explored

## Performance Metrics

- **Decision Time**: Time taken for AI to decide move
- **Nodes Explored**: Total game states evaluated
- **Pruning Efficiency**: Percentage of nodes pruned (Alpha-Beta only)
