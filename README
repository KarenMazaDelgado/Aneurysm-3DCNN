Project Title
Evaluating AI’s Capability to Detect Brain Vessel Abnormalities Compared to Radiologist Review
This project investigates how well AI models can identify abnormal blood vessel patterns in brain MRA scans compared to traditional radiologist review. Our group applied Python, deep learning methods, and biomedical imaging concepts within the AI4ALL Ignite accelerator to better understand how AI can support medical decision-making.
Problem Statement
Stroke prevention and early detection of vascular abnormalities rely heavily on accurate interpretation of brain MRA scans. Radiologists review these images manually, a process that is time-consuming and vulnerable to fatigue or human error. With the increasing volume of patients and imaging data, there is a growing need for tools that can support radiologists and improve diagnostic consistency.
This project explores whether AI — specifically deep learning models — can classify healthy and abnormal vessel segments with meaningful accuracy. Understanding AI’s strengths and weaknesses in this task has real impact on clinical workflows, second-reader systems, and neurovascular diagnostics.
Key Results (Expected / In Progress)
Processed and explored the VesselMNIST3D dataset containing 3D brain vessel segments.
Identified major sources of dataset imbalance, including a much larger number of healthy samples compared to aneurysm samples.
Began prototyping a 3D-CNN (3D ResNet) to classify vessel patterns.
Analyzed potential biases caused by image size, sampling methods, and demographic unknowns.
Established baseline evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, FPR) to compare model performance with radiologist benchmarks.
Methodologies
To carry out the project, we:
Used Python to load, preprocess, and visualize 3D vessel segments from the VesselMNIST3D dataset.
Built a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN), specifically a 3D ResNet architecture, to classify healthy vs abnormal vessel segments.
Evaluated the model using metrics commonly used in medical imaging, including accuracy, recall, and false-positive rates.
Identified dataset-level biases such as limited image resolution and imbalanced class distribution.
Compared AI outputs to expected radiologist performance to understand the model’s strengths and limitations.
Sources of Bias Identified
Low image resolution may limit the model’s ability to detect subtle vessel abnormalities.
Unknown demographics of the image contributors may reduce generalizability across diverse populations.
Class imbalance, with many more healthy samples than aneurysm samples, can cause the model to favor predicting healthy vessels.
